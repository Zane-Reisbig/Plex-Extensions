## Auto Skip Intro
See [index.ts](https://github.com/Zane-Reisbig/Plex-Extensions/blob/main/Auto-Skip-Intro/index.ts#L65) for the source.<br/>
See [CONFIG](https://github.com/Zane-Reisbig/Plex-Extensions/blob/8ddfd567ec7a621830d9c4e654ffc596acfc9c48/Auto-Skip-Intro/index.ts#L25) to change the timing settings.<br/>
There is an included built index.js, built with "tsc index.ts". You could also just strip the types, but IDK how to do that with tsc.<br/>
<br/>
Does just exactly that. Hooks a listener for the "Skip Intro" button, then clicks it.<br/>
Couldn't be simpler.<br/>
